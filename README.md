### About
Cafe Infinite is the working title I have for a project I've been thinking about for a long time. It's a simple platform I'd like to build to help connect people with their local businesses. With COVID, I don't see that being useful anytime soon, but hopefully I'll have it done by the time things return to normal, or to a new-normal.

### FireBase
I'm going to heavily rely on Google Firebase after being shown this tutorial:

Which makes it look super easy. This is my first firebase project.

### Google Maps
I will be using the Google maps API, and possibly other google cloud APIs. We'll see.
